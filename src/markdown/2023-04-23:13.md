# writing task 2 

___Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree___

```
disagree
full schedule
impact school learning
```

It is true that some people agree with the voluntary school activity being made mandatory for students. In my opinion, I totally disagree with this trend for few reasons.

There are several reason why I do not agree. Firstly, students schedule are already full by academic subjects such as a math, biology, chemistry, and language subject. Sometimes this academic subjects are added with addition subjects. Secondly, average students may face a difficult circumstance on their study understanding. Even, straight A students could have been affected by  the voluntary activity. Thirdly, the activity that is voluntary will not be useful if it is followed by reluctant participant. For example, the event I followed few months ago was unsuccessfull and lose a million dollars due to the lack of motivation of its members.
