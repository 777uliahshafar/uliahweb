# writing  task 2
compulsory community service  
school curriculum  
academic subjects  
exteremly busy timetable  
students performance  
obligatory work  

There are several reasons why I would argue **against** having **compulsory community service** for secondary school students. *Firstly*, the **school curriculum** is already full with important **academic subjects**, such as maths, science and languages. For example, I remember having an extremely busy timetable when I was at high school, and *it would not have been possible* to add to it. *Secondly*, *students' performance in other subjects would be affected if valuable study time were taken by charity work or neighbourhood improvement schemes.* *Finally*, I believe that teenage students would be **reluctant** to take part in any programme of **obligatory work**, and this could lead to poor motivation and even bad behaviour.

school subject already full  
perfomance on subject would be affected  
most student are reluctant
