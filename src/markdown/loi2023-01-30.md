## Paragraph one
Architecture has been a major influence in my life.
I have studied it maybe almost a decade since I was in a vocational high school until now.
In the beginning to the middle of vocational school, teachers have always been passionate teaching us about building drawing technique, including calculating planning budget and computer-aided drafting.
In the last term of school, teachers allowed me to did internship at the biggest cement company.
The asthonised and diversity experiences that I receive had became a motivation for me to continue study in undergradute degree.
