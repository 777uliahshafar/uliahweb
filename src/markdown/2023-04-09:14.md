social media app
install on a phone, in high school
because free time
addicted, negativ
great, success on all

I would like to tell you about the app that I recently **weed out** from phone.  
<span style="color:#cc241d;">This app is Instagram and any other app like that. </span>
I installed it from Play Store since I was high school in SMK 2. _There are several reason why I wanted to install those app_. Firstly, I had many free time when I had finsihed my exam. Secondly, All my friends were installing this so I followed the trend in my school. _However, now I wanted to rid of it for several reason as well._ Firstly, it has made me addicted using it. I could spend about five hours looking at screen while scrolling a lot of feed. Secondly, It wasted my time. After all my effort to **erridicate** this app, I have been feeling well and productive. I could spend my time on _beneficial thing_.
