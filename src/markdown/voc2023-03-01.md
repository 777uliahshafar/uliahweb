Mosses are small flowerless plants that usually grow in dense green clumps. The individual plant are usually composed of simple, one-cell thick leaves, covering a thin stem that supports them. At certain times they produce thin stalks topped with capsules containing spores. They are typically 1-10 centimetres tall, though some species are much larger, like Dawsonia, the tallest most in the world, which can grow to 50cm in height.
